= Content Lifecycle Management

Content lifecycle management allows you to customize and test packages before updating production clients.
This is especially useful if you need to apply updates during a limited maintenance window.



== Problem

Content lifecycle management allows you to select software channels as sources, adjust them as required for your environment, and thoroughly test them before installing onto your production clients.
You can use CLM to manage your software channels from development, through testing, and rolling the changes out to your clients.



== Solution

When you have completed this recipe, you will have a content lifecycle project set up.
You will have created a simple CLM project, and promoted through its lifecycle.
